Examples:\n- `node --harmony somebot.js`\n- `pm2 start somebot.js --node-args '--harmony'`\n\nNo version of Node older than 7.0.0 supports `async`/`await`, although you can compile it down to ES6 or ES5 with the\n[fast-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-async) Babel plugin. You must do this for your code and the framework's manually if you wish\nto use Commando on older Node versions.\n","path":"docs/general/welcome.md"},"first-steps":{"name":"First steps","type":"md","content":"# First steps\nThe first thing you need to do to use Commando is ensure you're creating a [CommandoClient](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/commando/master/class/CommandoClient)\nrather than the regular discord.js [Client](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/Client).\nA CommandoClient is just an extension of the base Client, so all options, properties, methods, and events on Client are also on CommandoClient.\n\nYou should provide the `owner` option to the constructor, which is an option specific to CommandoClient, and should be set to the ID of your Discord user.\nThis will give you full access to control everything about the bot, in any guild.\n\n```javascript\nconst Commando = require('discord.js-commando');\n\nconst client = new Commando.Client({\n\towner: '1234567890'\n});\n```\n\nThen, to make use of the command framework (what else would you be doing with Commando?), you need to register your command groups, commands, and argument types,\nin addition to any of the built-in stuff that you want make use of. This will look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = require('path');\n\nclient.registry\n\t// Registers your custom command groups\n\t.registerGroups([\n\t\t['fun', 'Fun commands'],\n\t\t['some', 'Some group'],\n\t\t['other', 'Some other group']\n\t])\n\n\t// Registers all built-in groups, commands, and argument types\n\t.registerDefaults()\n\n\t// Registers all of your commands in the ./commands/ directory\n\t.registerCommandsIn(path.join(__dirname, 'commands'));\n```\n\nCommando has built-in command prefix configuration per-guild, as well as enabling and disabling commands per-guild.\nIn order for this to persist across restarts, you should use a [SettingProvider](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/commando/master/class/SettingProvider).\nThere is a built-in SQLiteProvider that comes with Commando, which stores all settings in an SQLite3 database.\nTo use it, install the `sqlite` module with NPM (`npm install --save sqlite`). Then, set the provider on the client:\n\n```javascript\nconst sqlite = require('sqlite');\n\nclient.setProvider(\n\tsqlite.open(path.join(__dirname, 'settings.sqlite3')).then(db => new Commando.SQLiteProvider(db))\n).catch(console.error);\n```\n\nFinally, you must log in, just as if you were using a regular Client.\n\n```javascript\nclient.login('token goes here');\n```\n\nThere is an extremely simple example bot used to test Commando, of which you can view the source [here](https://github.com/Gawdl3y/discord.js-commando/tree/master/test).\n","path":"docs/general/first-steps.md"}}},"commands":{"name":"Commands","files":{"builtins":{"name":"Built-in commands","type":"md","content":"# Built-in commands\nCommando has built-in commands that should be useful for just about any bot.\n\n## Utility (util)\n### help (util:help)\nIf no arguments are specified, the command displays a list of all commands available in the current context.\nIn order for a command to be displayed, it must be enabled in the guild (or global), and the user must have permission to use it.\nPassing the `all` argument will list all commands, regardless of context.\nPassing anything else will search for any commands that match, and display detailed information if only one is found.\n\n### ping (util:ping)\nThe ping command will send a message, then edit it to contain the amount of time it took.\nIt also displays the client's heartbeat ping.\n\n### prefix (util:prefix)\nThis command, if not provided with any arguments, will display the current command prefix, and how to use commands.\nIf the command is used in a guild channel and an argument is specified, it will set the command prefix for the guild if the user is a guild admin, or the bot owner,\nIf the command is used in a DM and an argument is specified, it will set the global default command prefix if the user is the bot owner.\n\n### eval (util:eval)\nThe eval command will allow the bot owner to evaluate any JavaScript code, and display its result.\nIt will automatically hide the bot's token/email/password in the output.\nCaution should still be taken, however, as you could potentially break your running bot with it.\n\nIn the script, `this` will refer to the Command instance.\nThere are several shortcut variables and helpers that are also available:\n\n| Name             | Type     | Description                                                                        |\n|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `message`, `msg` | Variable | The message that triggered the command                                             |\n| `client`         | Variable | Shortcut to `this.client`                                                          |\n| `objects`        | Variable | Shortcut to `this.client.registry.evalObjects`                                     |\n| `lastResult`     | Variable | Shortcut to `this.lastResult` (the previous `eval` result value)                   |\n| `doReply(val)`   | Function | Sends another detailed message with any value to display.
