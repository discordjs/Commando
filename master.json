This will look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = require('path');\n\nclient.registry\n\t// Registers your custom command groups\n\t.registerGroups([\n\t\t['fun', 'Fun commands'],\n\t\t['some', 'Some group'],\n\t\t['other', 'Some other group']\n\t])\n\n\t// Registers all built-in groups, commands, and argument types\n\t.registerDefaults()\n\n\t// Registers all of your commands in the ./commands/ directory\n\t.registerCommandsIn(path.join(__dirname, 'commands'));\n```\n\nCommando has built-in command prefix configuration per-guild, as well as enabling and disabling commands per-guild.\nIn order for this to persist across restarts, you should use a [SettingProvider](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/commando/master/class/SettingProvider).\nThere is a built-in SQLiteProvider that comes with Commando, which stores all settings in an SQLite3 database.\nTo use it, install the `sqlite` and the `sqlite3` module with NPM (`npm install --save sqlite sqlite3`). Then, set the provider on the client:\n\n```javascript\nconst sqlite = require('sqlite');\nconst sqlite3 = require('sqlite3');\n\nclient.setProvider(\n\tsqlite.open({ filename: 'database.db', driver: sqlite3.Database }).then(db => new Commando.SQLiteProvider(db))\n).catch(console.error);\n```\n\nFinally, you must log in, just as if you were using a regular Client.\n\n```javascript\nclient.login('token goes here');\n```\n\nThere is an extremely simple example bot used to test Commando, of which you can view the source [here](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando/tree/master/test).\n","path":"docs/general/first-steps.md"}}},"commands":{"name":"Commands","files":{"builtins":{"name":"Built-in commands","type":"md","content":"# Built-in commands\nCommando has built-in commands that should be useful for just about any bot.\n\n## Utility (util)\n### help (util:help)\nIf no arguments are specified, the command displays a list of all commands available in the current context.\nIn order for a command to be displayed, it must be enabled in the guild (or global), and the user must have permission to use it.\nPassing the `all` argument will list all commands, regardless of context.\nPassing anything else will search for any commands that match, and display detailed information if only one is found.\n\n### ping (util:ping)\nThe ping command will send a message, then edit it to contain the amount of time it took.\nIt also displays the client's heartbeat ping.\n\n### prefix (util:prefix)\nThis command, if not provided with any arguments, will display the current command prefix, and how to use commands.\nIf the command is used in a guild channel and an argument is specified, it will set the command prefix for the guild if the user is a guild admin, or the bot owner,\nIf the command is used in a DM and an argument is specified, it will set the global default command prefix if the user is the bot owner.\n\n### eval (util:eval)\nThe eval command will allow the bot owner to evaluate any JavaScript code, and display its result.\nIt will automatically hide the bot's token/email/password in the output.\nCaution should still be taken, however, as you could potentially break your running bot with it.\n\nIn the script, `this` will refer to the Command instance.\nThere are several shortcut variables and helpers that are also available:\n\n| Name             | Type     | Description                                                                        |\n|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `message`, `msg` | Variable | The message that triggered the command                                             |\n| `client`         | Variable | Shortcut to `this.client`                                                          |\n| `objects`        | Variable | Shortcut to `this.client.registry.evalObjects`                                     |\n| `lastResult`     | Variable | Shortcut to `this.lastResult` (the previous `eval` result value)                   |\n| `doReply(val)`   | Function | Sends another detailed message with any value to display.
