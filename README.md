## About

Commando is a command framework for [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).
It is flexible, fully object-oriented, easy to use, and makes it trivial to create your own powerful commands.
Additionally, it makes full use of ES2017's `async`/`await` functionality for clear, concise code that is simple to write and easy to comprehend.

## Features

### New features in this fork

- Async inhibitors
- Async provider loading (loading only guilds that are actually needed)
- Services
- Aliases for commands
- Arguments accessible for types
- Some default messages can be turned off (so they can be handled by event handler instead, allowing for translation)

### Commando base features

- Plain command names and aliases
- Regular expression triggers
- Robust parsing of arguments (with "quoted strings" support)
- Sophisticated argument system (optional)
  - Automatic prompting for arguments that aren't provided
  - Type system with rules, automatic validation, and parsing to usable values
    - Basic types (string, integer, float, boolean)
    - Discord objects (user, member, role, channel, message)
    - User-defined custom types
    - Union types
  - Automatic re-prompting of invalid arguments
  - Optional arguments with default values
  - Infinite arguments (arguments that accept as many values as provided)
- Multiple responses to commands
- Command editing (user edits their message that triggered the command, and the bot's response updates with it)
- Command reloading, as well as loading/unloading
- Command throttling/cooldowns
